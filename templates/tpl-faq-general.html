					    <h3 class="FAQquestion">What is equity crowdfunding?</h3>
					    <p class="FAQanswer">Equity crowdfunding is where the individuals who provide the funding are given a percentage of equity ownership in the company that they are funding. While equity interests are bought and sold for large, SEC registered companies the availability of this form of fundraising (selling an ownership interest in the company) has been limited for smaller companies by the current securities laws and the costs of meeting the existing rules and regulations surrounding public equity offerings. Increasingly, however, on both an international and national level, the regulatory barriers to this form of fundraising are being removed. In the United States, the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012 was intended, among other things, to help spur the growth and development of equity crowdfunding as a way to finance small businesses.</p>
