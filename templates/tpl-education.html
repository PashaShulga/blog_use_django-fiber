                                            Issuers listed on GrowthFountain will offer one of two different
                                            types of securities:

                                            Preferred Equity. Preferred Equity is a form of equity security that
                                            has a higher claim on the assets and earnings of the company than
                                            common stock. Preferred Equity generally has a dividend that must be
                                            paid out before dividends to common stockholders and the shares
                                            usually do not have voting rights.
                                        </p>

                                            Payback Equity. Payback Equity is a form of revenue share unique to
                                            Growthfountain listed companies. In this security, the issuer agrees
                                            to share a percentage of their revenue with investors. The issuer
                                            determines the specific percentages of the revenue share. This
                                            security is generally callable by the issuer at any time.

                                            As a general matter, investments in small businesses and start-up
                                            companies are often risky. For example, if a company is new, its
                                            management may be inexperienced and investors will not be able to
                                            evaluate the company’s operating history. Small businesses may
                                            also depend heavily upon a single customer, supplier, or employee
                                            whose departure would seriously damage the company’s
                                            profitability.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The demand for the company’s product may be seasonal or be
                                            impacted by the overall economy, or the company could face other
                                            risks that are specific to its industry or type of business. The
                                            company may also have a hard time competing against larger companies
                                            who can negotiate for better prices from suppliers, produce goods
                                            and services on a large scale more economically, or take advantage
                                            of bigger marketing budgets. Furthermore, a small business could
                                            face risks from lawsuits, governmental regulations, and other
                                            potential impediments to growth.
                                            <strong>
                                                According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, half of all
                                                new businesses fail within 5 years.
                                            </strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Small investors typically have very little power, so they are unable
                                            to influence the management decisions that affect the profitability
                                            of the investment. New investors are often asked to pay more money
                                            for their shares than the company’s officers or principal
                                            owners (who may have contributed “sweat equity”).
                                            Furthermore, the value of the small investor’s ownership share
                                            in the company’s assets (the “tangible book
                                            value”) is almost always less than the amount paid for the
                                            shares.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In addition, the value of the ownership interest represented by
                                            certain securities may be diluted by later issuances. In addition
                                            to these general risks related to investing in small companies, you
                                            should carefully consider the specific information and risks
                                            disclosed by the company issuing the securities. It may be difficult
                                            or impossible to recover your money if the investment does not
                                            perform as expected. Due to limited regulatory oversight over these
                                            types of offerings, investors may be left on their own to pursue to
                                            costly private lawsuits when things go wrong.

                                                Because of these risks, you should not invest any funds in a

                                                You also should not invest if you may have an immediate need for
                                                the return of your funds.

                                            Securities issued in reliance upon an exemption for
                                            “crowdfunding” are subject to a 12 month holding period,
                                            so investors will be unable to freely resell their securities for at
                                            least a year. The company may also restrict re-sales of its
                                            securities. Even after these restrictions are lifted, it may be
                                            difficult to resell these types of securities because they are not
                                            listed on any securities exchanges and a public trading market may
                                            never develop.

                                            You should consider the terms and risks of a crowdfunding offering
                                            before you invest. No government regulator has verified that the
                                            disclosure document is accurate or determined that it is adequate.
                                            No government regulator is recommending these securities, and it is
                                            a crime for anyone to tell you differently.

                                            When a company lists an offering on the GrowthFountain site it will
                                            include the principal terms of the offering, including the type of
                                            security being offered, the overall amount of the offering and, if
                                            applicable, an expected closing date for the offering.

                                            Investor’s may make a commitment to invest in the offering by
                                            indicating their commitment on the GrowthFountain site at which time
                                            funds will be placed in escrow. A commitment may be cancelled for
                                            any reason until 48 hours prior to the closing date for the offering
                                            transaction (the closing date will be identified in the
                                            issuer’s offering materials). The exact timing of the
                                            cancellation deadline will also be included in a confirmation notice
                                            that is sent to you after you have submitted your commitment. There
                                            will be no opportunity to cancel your commitment in the 48 hours
                                            immediately preceding the closing of the transaction unless there
                                            are material changes to the terms of the offering during that
                                            period. If an issuer makes a material change to their offering,
                                            investors will have to reconfirm their investment. If an investor
                                            does not reconfirm his or her investment commitment after a material
                                            change is made to the offering, the investor’s investment
                                            commitment will be cancelled and the committed funds will be
                                            returned.

                                            crowdfunded offerings in any 12-month period. The maximum amount that

                                            Please note that investors may cancel an investment commitment until
                                            48 hours prior to the deadline identified in the issuer’s
                                            offering materials. GrowthFountain will notify investors when the
                                            target offering has been met. If an issuer reaches the target

                                            materials, it may close the offering early if it provides notice
                                            about the new offering deadline (absent a material change that would
                                            require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the
                                            investment commitment). If an investor does not cancel an investment
                                            commitment before the 48-hour period prior to the offering deadline,
